            Snacker is a real-time food truck geolocation app that I begun
                working on in June 2021. The app is free to use and trucks can create
                a profile where all they need to do is click an update location button 
                and their location on the map will change to where they are when holding
                their phone and clicking the button. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/snacker-download">
                    This is a download link for the app.</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            The current revenue model for the app is running ads and in the future I plan on
            creating an automated system to connect users that want catering or private events services to
            trucks that offer such services. Scaling an app is difficult because it's no longer about
            getting featured overnight and going viral; The biggest application distribution channels are no longer distribution
            channels because they are so big. Snacker has the scaling issues of a 2 sided marketplace (even though it's 
            free) because no users want to use an app with no trucks and no trucks want to use an app with no users. However,
            even though the value propositions of users and trucks are proportional to each other I have still make some traction
            in the first week and a half after launch. I currently have 6 trucks and 40 users without spending any money on marketing. Also,
            food trucks are in extremely high competition so their incentive to get on the app increases with the number of users and 
            the number of trucks. I have other commitments too. University applications and school remains a priority, but I have figured out 
            strategies for maintaing the app at the same time. I plan on writing more about Snacker soon.
