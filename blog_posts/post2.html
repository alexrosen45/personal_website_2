                Dogebot is the first somewhat functional trading bot that I have made. Every ten seconds it monitors for Elon Musk tweets that contain the keyword 
                doge in order to buy and hold dogecoin for short periods of time. I have not actually connected the program to a crypto wallet yet because I first
                need to figure out whether it actually makes money or not. For the time being, whenever Elon tweets about doge the bot will buy it instanly and hold
                it for exactly 1 hour. After it sells, it resumes looking for tweets regarding doge and records the percent change in the price of doge during the 
                holding time in a csv file. I am almost able to run it for 24 hours because the only issue left to fix is to extend the number of API requests I can
                make continuously using tweepy (Twitter's API library). The project is currently running on a raspberry pi 4 in my room and I have surprisingly not
                had any wireless internet connection issues. Now I just have to wait and see whether or not my idea works.
              </p>
              <p>
                If I get poor results for percent changes during hypothetical holding times there is 1 potential flaw which can be address. The bot purchases dogecoin
                for exactly 1hr after Elon tweets, but this is just an arbitrary time period that I selected. Dogebot 1.0 is more of a proof of concept that helped
                me figure out how to build a crypto trading bot. The best approach to obtaining optimal return would be to setup an automated process for finding the 
                best average holding time with the highest precent return after a tweet. For example, instead of recording data for the percent change in 1hr I could
                do it for a range from 15min to 5hrs with 15min increments. If this was implemented I would also have to swap out the crypto price API I am using
                provided by Coin Market Cap for something quicker and more time specific to retain accuracy. If the 1hr time period proves to be problematic, I plan
                on including a solution to it in the 1.1 release.
              </p>
              <p>
                Future features that will be added if the project ends up generating money will be connections to a crypto wallet and bank account along with a proper
                interface for the program that could be through a section of this website. The code for Dogebot 1.0 can be found <a href="https://github.com/alexrosen45/dogebot1.0">here</a>.
