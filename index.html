            <p>
              Welcome to my personal website! I created this website when I was in 11th grade to begin learning full stack web development, 
              along with how to run a live website off my own server. Aside from using this website to store my contact information and write 
               about my projects I could use it as a login page/portal to any online service I would want to create. This 
               current version and all previous versions of this website are in repositories in my github which is linked in the 
               footer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am currently a grade 12 student at the York School in Toronto and I am excited to keep using this website to document stuff that I do. I am 
              interested in majoring in computer science because why would I want to major in anything else. Right now I am working
              on an app called Snacker, which provides food truck locations in real-time. I wrote about it in my blog and I plan
              on making a section on this website for it soon.
